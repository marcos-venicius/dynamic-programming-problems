## How to add new problems?

don't worry about that! i'd created a script in python that solve this problem.

to create a new problem:

```bash
python create.py problem-name-without-spaces
```

> please, follow the name convension using the "-" to separate the words

to improve the current problem:

```bash
python create.py improve
```

really, just it.
